    description: "The first-generation Renault Duster (also marketed as Dacia Duster in many markets) was developed as an affordable compact SUV for global markets, built on the B0 platform shared with the Logan and Sandero. Designed with a focus on simplicity, ruggedness, and value, the Duster measured approximately 4.3 meters in length and featured a relatively high ground clearance of 210mm in four-wheel-drive variants. The exterior design emphasized utilitarian SUV elements with black plastic body cladding, roof rails, and skid plates. Powertrain options varied significantly by market but typically included 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter gasoline engines as well as Renault's 1.5-liter dCi diesel in various states of tune, with power outputs ranging from 85 to 150 horsepower. Available in both front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive configurations, the all-wheel-drive system featured three modes: 2WD, Auto (which distributed torque as needed), and Lock (which fixed torque distribution for challenging conditions). The interior was basic but functional, with durable materials and straightforward controls. Equipment levels were modest, though higher trims offered features like air conditioning, power windows, and basic infotainment systems. A facelift in 2013 introduced subtle styling updates, improved interior materials, and additional equipment options. Despite its simplicity, the first-generation Duster proved enormously successful globally, particularly in emerging markets and price-sensitive European regions, selling over two million units worldwide and establishing itself as one of the most accessible compact SUVs available."

    description: "The second-generation Renault Duster (or Dacia Duster in many markets) debuted in late 2017 for the 2018 model year, maintaining the model's philosophy of affordable robustness while improving quality, design, and technology. While still based on the B0 platform, the architecture was significantly updated to improve refinement and safety. The exterior design represents an evolution of its predecessor with more modern styling elements including C-shaped LED signature lighting, a more muscular stance, and improved aerodynamics, while maintaining similar dimensions at approximately 4.3 meters in length. Ground clearance remains generous at 210mm for 4WD versions, with approach and departure angles suitable for legitimate off-road use. Engine options again vary by market but typically include a 1.0-liter TCe and 1.3-liter TCe gasoline engines (developed with Mercedes-Benz), the familiar 1.5-liter dCi diesel, and in some markets, bi-fuel petrol/LPG options. Power outputs range from 100 to 150 horsepower, with transmission choices including manual, automated manual (Easy-R), and dual-clutch automatic (EDC) depending on engine and market. The four-wheel-drive system was refined with a new 4x4 monitor that displays the vehicle's angle in real-time. Interior quality improved significantly with a redesigned dashboard featuring better materials, a higher-mounted infotainment screen (up to 8 inches), and more comfortable seating. New technology includes multi-view camera systems, blind-spot warning, automatic climate control, and keyless entry on higher trims. Safety was enhanced with reinforced structure, additional airbags, and electronic stability control as standard. Despite increasing competition, the second-generation Duster continues to succeed globally by maintaining its value proposition while addressing many of the first generation's shortcomings in refinement, technology, and perceived quality."
